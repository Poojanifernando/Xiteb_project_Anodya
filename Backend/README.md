## Xiteb Project 
This is the backend of the project. I have used Mern stack for the project and i have used node Js
and express js  for the backend  implementation. also i gor mongoDB Altes Ui for db connection. the connection url is in .env file in the backend.
i have used my existing mongodb project to test this project. so ignore the project's names.but the collections names are correctly defined.

You can clone the repository to your computer as i have added this project to Github and also unzip the zip file and open it in Visual studio code and redirect to the project directory . 
direct to the  backend folder and use folloeing commands to install all the packages and run the project.
```
npm install or npm install --force
```

all the packages will install correctly. if not you can use ,
npm install <package name>

backend is running on port 5000.
